# Sociative Relation
This relation is used to denote the associative or dissociative aspects of sense, that is, the notions of " **with / together**" and " **without/ not having with**". It may further be classified into two sub-relations.

2. Sociative (Implicit) Relation3 (SOI)

Puttena gacchati =... goes (with) the son.
Puttena ——> (saha) (SOI)

In the example above, the sense of saha meaning "together" is only implied, not directly expressed. This relation cannot be used for the sense "without".
